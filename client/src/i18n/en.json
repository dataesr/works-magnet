  "feedback-description-1": "AI techniques are used on a large scale to analyse bibliographic corpora. In particular, OpenAlex uses them to construct affiliation links in publications (used for the Leiden ranking) and Grobid-Softcite to detect mentions of data and software in the full text. Helping to correct these data improves the reliability and representativeness of these analyses.",
  "feedback-description-2": "OpenAlex associates affiliation signatures with ROR identifiers. Errors and omissions can occur, distorting the results obtained from OpenAlex data, such as the (open) Leiden ranking. Similarly, tools are used to detect mentions of software and data sets in the full text of publications. Here too, these detections may contain errors. The Works-magnet allows you to explore all the mentions detected in the French corpus and to report any errors. These reports will be added to the learning database, helping to train new, more reliable detection models. In this way, helping to correct these data improves the reliability and representativeness of these analyses.",

  "about-title": "Works-magnet : a tool for metadata specialists",
  "about-1": "The Works-magnet offers a number of curation functions. The tool is therefore aimed at specialists who can judge the quality of metadata. The tool interrogates various massive databases (OpenAlex, BSO, Datacite) and formats the information to facilitate exploration and correction where necessary. These massive databases each use large-scale automatic processing tools. An expert curatorial eye is needed to continue to improve the quality of the metadata. As far as possible, the corrections resulting from these curations are fed back upstream to ensure that the same errors are not repeated. The aim is to build up a set of high-quality metadata that can be re-used by anyone who wishes to do so. The aim is to propose a new curation paradigm: curation is not carried out in a two-way relationship between a producer and a consumer of data. Instead, a group of data users propose corrections that are visible to all, and that can benefit everyone. As well as correcting the cases reported, in some cases the data collected can also be re-used as learning data for algorithms, so that the models used in the future are more effective.",
  "about-2": "One of the major features of the Works-magnet is the improvement of affiliation metadata. This is of vital importance in the bibliometric analyses carried out by institutions. They are also used to establish the Leiden ranking (open). Improving the quality of this data will enable us to benefit collectively from more reliable monitoring and analysis tools in the future.",
  "about-3": "The Works-magnet aims to fill a gap: at a time when ‘open research information’ (to use the terms of the Barcelona Declaration) is progressing rapidly, there is a clear need to draw on the knowledge of experts to raise the level of quality of metadata. It is highly likely that in the months and years to come, more structured networks for collecting information will be set up, for example by OpenAlex or following the work of the COMET working group initiated by the California Digital Library. It may take a long time to set up this kind of structure, and the Works-magnet is positioning itself to meet this need as of now.",
